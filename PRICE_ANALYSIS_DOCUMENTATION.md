### 5. Solar Optimization Strategy ‚òÄÔ∏è

#### **Core Analysis: Store vs Sell Immediately**

**Scenario**: Customer produces solar energy 11 AM - 3 PM
- **Option A**: Sell immediately at solar peak prices
- **Option B**: Store in battery, sell during evening peak

#### **Results**
- **Solar peak price** (11 AM-3 PM): 98.50 EUR/MWh
- **Evening peak price** (5 PM-9 PM): 157.23 EUR/MWh
- **Storage premium**: 58.73 EUR/MWh (0.0587 EUR/kWh)
- **Profitable days**: 88.9% (974 out of 1,095 days)

#### **Financial Example**
```
Daily solar production: 15 kWh
Battery capacity: 10 kWh (can store 67% of production)

Option A - Immediate Sale:
15 kWh √ó 0.0985 EUR/kWh = 1.48 EUR

Option B - Storage Strategy:
Immediate sale: 5 kWh √ó 0.0985 = 0.49 EUR
Battery storage: 10 kWh √ó 90% efficiency = 9 kWh
Evening sale: 9 kWh √ó 0.157 = 1.41 EUR
Total: 0.49 + 1.41 = 1.90 EUR

Daily benefit: 1.90 - 1.48 = 0.42 EUR
Annual benefit: 0.42 √ó 365 = 153 EUR
```

- **Peak timing**: Early morning (4-8 AM) and evening (5-7 PM)
- **Maximum value**: 872.96 EUR/MWh
- **Strategic value**: Reserve battery capacity for these events

#### **Risk Management**
- **Diversification**: Don't rely solely on extreme events
- **Preparation**: Maintain 20% battery capacity for unexpected spikes
- **Monitoring**: Set alerts for forecast extreme events
- **Balancing**: Combine daily arbitrage with extreme event capture
